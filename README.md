# SOSPy

A Python version of MATLAB SOSTOOLS.

SOSPy_sympy contains functions based on **sympy** package. However, in case of a large number of decision variables, **sympy** may take a long time to parse the data. 
Therefore, a new structure **dpvar** is introduced, although the Python version of functions based on **dpvar** is not done yet.

Some demos are in **Sympy_demos** folder.
